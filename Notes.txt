Avoid Hungarian Notation and Prefixes
Do you know Charles Simonyi? Charles Simonyi is a Hungarian-American computer software expert who
worked as a Chief Architect at Microsoft in the 1980s. Maybe you remember his name in a different context.
Charles Simonyi is a space tourist and has made two trips into space, one of them to the International Space
Station (ISS).
But he also developed a notation convention for naming variables in computer software, named
the Hungarian notation, which has been widely used inside Microsoft and later, also, by other software
manufacturers.
When using Hungarian Notation, the type, and sometimes also the scope, of a variable are used as a
naming prefix for that variable. Here are a few examples:

And another problem is that in object-oriented languages that support polymorphism, the prefix cannot
be specified easily, or a prefix can even be puzzling. Which Hungarian prefix is suitable for a polymorphic
variable that can be an integer or a double? idX? diX? How to determine a suitable and unmistakable prefix
for an instantiated C++ template?
