# Clean Code
- Clean Code is not  a beautiful code and has no beauty reasons
- Professional programmers are not paid for writing beautiful or pretty
code
- Code is clean if it can be understood and maintained easily by any team member.
- Clean code is the basis for being fast
	- If your code is clean and test coverage is good, a change or a new
function just take a few hours or a couple of days – and not weeks or months
- Clean code is the foundation for sustainable software and keeps a software development project running over a long time without accumulating a large amount of technical debt
- Clean code is also a key to make a happier developer
	- It leads to a stress-free life
	- If code is clean and developer feeling comfortable with it,  keep calm in every situation, even in front of a tight project deadline.
- Clean code saves money (economic efficiency)
	- Each year, development organizations lose a lot of money because
their code is in bad shape

### Why Code should be Bug Free 
- **`There is no life today without software!`**
- Board an elevator, we give our lives are in the hands of software. Aircrafts are controlled by
software, and the entire, worldwide air traffic control system depends on software. Our modern cars contain
a significant amount of small computer systems with software that communicate over a network, responsible
for many safety-critical functions of the vehicle. Air conditioning, automatic doors, medical devices, trains,
automated production lines in factories … No matter what we’re doing nowadays, we permanently come
into touch with software. And with the Digital Revolution and the Internet of Things (IoT), the relevance of
software for our life will again increase significantly. Hardly any other topic is this more evident than with
the autonomous (driverless) car.
