# Clean Code
- Clean Code is not  a beautiful code and has no beauty reasons
- Professional programmers are not paid for writing beautiful or pretty
code
- Code is clean if it can be understood and maintained easily by any team member.
- Clean code is the basis for being fast
	- If your code is clean and test coverage is good, a change or a new
function just take a few hours or a couple of days â€“ and not weeks or months
- Clean code is the foundation for sustainable software and keeps a software development project running over a long time without accumulating a large amount of technical debt
- Clean code is also a key to make a happier developer
	- It leads to a stress-free life
	- If code is clean and developer feeling comfortable with it,  keep calm in every situation, even in front of a tight project deadline.
- Clean code saves money (economic efficiency)
	- Each year, development organizations lose a lot of money because
their code is in bad shape

### Why Code should be Bug Free 
- There is no life today without software!
