code
- Code is clean if it can be understood and maintained easily by any team member.

	- If your code is clean and test coverage is good, a change or a new
function just take a few hours or a couple of days â€“ and not weeks or months
- Clean code is the foundation for sustainable software and keeps a software development project running over a long time without accumulating a large amount of technical debt
- Clean code is also a key to make a happier developer
	- It leads to a stress-free life
	- If code is clean and develo feeling comfortable with it, you can keep calm in every situation, even in front of a tight
project deadline.
