# Obejct Oriented Thinking

>I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages (so messaging came at the very beginning – it took a while to see how to do messaging in a programming language efficiently enough to be useful). (…) OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things.
—**Dr. Alan Curtis Kay, American computer scientist, July 23, 2003 [Ram03]**

**Object orientation (OO)** is primarily a **mindset**, and less a matter of the language used. And it can also be **abused** and **misapplied**

### Main Challenges
- How do I find and form the objects?
- How do I design the public available interface of those cells?
- How do I govern who can communicate with whom (dependencies)?

#### Abstraction – the Key to Master Complexity

#### Guiding Principles for Object Oriented Decomposition
- Information hiding ,
-  Strong cohesion,
-  Loose coupling 
-  Single Responsibility

#### Principles for Good Class Design
- Keep Classes Small
	- no more than 50 lines of code for a single class.
