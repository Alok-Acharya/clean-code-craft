## Good Names
**Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.**
â€”Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, 1984
- Source code is read much more often by developers than translated by a compiler
- source code should be readable, and good names are a key factor to increase its readability
- Source code files, namespaces, classes, templates, functions, arguments, variables, and constants should have meaningful and expressive names.
