## Good Names
**Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.**
—Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, 1984
- Source code is read much more often by developers than translated by a compiler
- source code should be readable, and good names are a key factor to increase its readability
- Source code files, namespaces, classes, templates, functions, arguments, variables, and constants should have meaningful and expressive names.
### Few bits of advice for finding good names.
- Names Should Be Self-Explanatory
	- Use simple but descriptive and self-explaining names.
	- Too long and verbose names are not appropriate or desirable
	- If the context is clear in which a variable is used, shorter and less descriptive names are possible
	- If the variable is a member (attribute) of a class, for instance, the class’s name usually provides sufficient context for the variable
- Use Names from the Domain
	- DDD
	- Name components, classes, and functions in a way that elements and concepts from the application’s domain can be rediscovered
- Choose Names at an Appropriate Level of Abstraction
	- To keep the complexity of today’s software systems under control, these systems are usually hierarchically
decomposed.
